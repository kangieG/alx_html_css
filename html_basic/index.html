    <p>This is the basic HTML structure</p>
    <h1>MY FIRST TOPIC</h1>
        <p>
            A variable has a name, a data type, and a value. <br>
            There is a location in memory associated with each variable. <br>
            A variable can be called anything or be given any name. <br>
            It is considered good practice to use variable names that are relevant to 
            the task at hand.
        </p>
    <h2>THE SECOND TOPIC</h2>
        <p>
            The left side is the variable a value is being stored in and the right side is where the variable 
            is being accessed. <br>
            When a variable is assigned a value, the old value is written over with the new value so the old value is gone. <br>
        </p>
    <h3>THIRD TOPIC</h3>
    <p>
        Input / Output both deal with an outside source (can be a user or another program) receiving or giving information. <br>
        An example would be assuming a fast food restaurant is a program.
